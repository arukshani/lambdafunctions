Understanding katna
======================

As mentioned in intro section katna consists of two modules,
Video and Image, In this section we will go into details about 
each modules working. 

Katna.video Module:
--------------------

Video module handles the task(s) for key frame(s) extraction and video compression.
This module has four primary public functions for keyframe extraction
video_compression, which are **extract_video_keyframes**, **extract_keyframes_from_videos_dir**, **compress_video** and **compress_videos_from_dir**.

**extract_video_keyframes** is the primary function which given a video file
extracts most important keyframe from a video. **extract_keyframes_from_videos_dir**
actually runs extract_video_frames function for all video files in a directory
recursively.
Katna.video frame extraction feature first takes a video and divides a big video in smaller chunks of 
videos, it runs video frame extraction and frame selector tasks on these chunked
videos in parallel. For each chunked video actual frame extraction is done in
Katna by following two separate modules.

Details about public  **compress_video** and **compress_videos_from_dir**
functions is listed in :ref:`Katna.video_compressor`. 

Katna.frame_extractor module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In frame extractor module given a input video all the video frames that
are sufficiently different from previous ones using absolute differences
in LUV colorspace are returned.

Katna.frame_selector module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Katna.frame_selector module given list of frames
returned from frame_extractor module following checks are performed: 

1. Brightness score filtering of extracted frames.
2. Entropy/contrast score filtering of extracted frames.

Each of these properties are filtered based on threshold which you can check
and edit in Katna.config.ImageSelector properties. 

After frame filtering based on number of required frames N, N clusters are 
formed using K-Means clustering where K=N, clustering is done using
image histogram based approach. 
After K-Means clustering, for each cluster selection of best frame from
cluster is done using variance of laplacian sorting. In image processing world 
variance of laplacian method is often used for image blur detection. 
This sorting and selection ensures that least blurred image is selected
from cluster.


.. _Katna.video_compressor:

Katna.video_compressor module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from Frame extraction Katna.video module can also do efficient video
compression. It is done by internal module called internally by Katna.video_compressor
module and exposed publicly by two public functions: 
**compress_video** and **compress_videos_from_dir**
As the name suggests **compress_video** function does video compression on a
single input video file and **compress_videos_from_dir** function recursively
compresses all videos in a given input folder.
Katna.video_compressor includes actual implementation of video compression using ffmpeg
library.

As discussed  **compress_video** functions
can compress a given input video and saves the output in same folder with
name=original_input_file_name + "_compressed" with mp4 extension. You can change
this behavior and other Configurations using optional parameters. 
 
In case you play around with the different parameters like where to save compressed file etc.
you can change optional parameters in compress_video function.
Below are the optional parameters supported by the method

1. **force_overwrite** (bool, optional) – optional parameter if True then if there \
is already a file in output file location function will overwrite it, defaults to False

2. **crf_parameter** (int, optional) – Constant Rate Factor Parameter for 
controlling amount of video compression to be applied, The range of the quantizer 
scale is 0-51: where 0 is lossless, 23 is default, and 51 is worst possible. 
It is recommend to keep this value between 20 to 30 A lower value is a higher quality, 
you can change default value by changing config.Video.video_compression_crf_parameter

3. **output_video_codec** (str, optional) – Type of video codec to choose, 
Currently supported options are libx264 and libx265, libx264 is default option. 
libx264 is more widely supported on different operating systems and platforms, 
libx265 uses more advanced x265 codec and results in better compression and even 
less output video sizes with same or better quality. Right now libx265 is not as 
widely compatible on older versions of MacOS and Widows by default. 
If wider video compatibility is your goal you should use libx264., 
you can change default value by changing Katna.config.Video.video_compression_codec

4. **out_dir_path** (str, optional) – output folder path where you want output 
video to be saved, defaults to “”

5. **out_file_name** (str, optional) – output filename, if not mentioned it will 
be same as input filename, defaults to “”


.. _Katna.video_resize:

Katna.video_resize module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As mentioned in home section since version 0.8.0 of Katna we are extending
smart resize features to videos with the help of Google's Mediapipe project.
In simple terms video resize functionality in Katna currently is a thin
python wrapper around Google Mediapipe Autoflip solution. If you want to learn
more about how it works under the hood Please refer to this blog post by 
Google AI: https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/autoflip-open-source-framework-for.html .
Please refer to :ref:`tutorials_video_smart_resize`
for how to install and configure mediapipe to be used with katna. 
Right now following parameters are configurable using Katna video module:


#. **STABALIZATION_THRESHOLD**  (float, optional) – 
   defaults to "0.5" : This parameter controls extent of motion stabilization is applied
   while tracking an object or face across the frames for video resizing. Higher value Means
   more aggressive motion stabilization and vice versa.

#. **BLUR_AREA_OPACITY**  (int, optional) – defaults to “0.6”
   In some cases e.g. while compulsorily including all faces across frames, it is not possible to do
   without rendering padding in video. In case overlay of same video content is used as padding.
   This parameter controls how much opacity to add to padded content. 

#. **ENFORCE_FEATURES.FACE_CORE_LANDMARKS**  (bool, optional) – defaults to **False**
   In case of this parameter set as true, It is ensured that all face present in video are compulsorily
   included in final resized video.

#. **ENFORCE_FEATURES.FACE_FULL**  (bool, optional) – defaults to **False**
   In case of this parameter set as true, It is ensured that all full faces present in video are compulsorily
   included in final resized video.

#. **ENFORCE_FEATURES.HUMAN**  (bool, optional) – defaults to **False**
   In case of this parameter set as true, It is ensured that all persons/humans present/detected 
   in video are compulsorily included in final resized video.

#. **ENFORCE_FEATURES.PET**  (bool, optional) – defaults to **False**
   In case of this parameter set as true, It is ensured that all PET's like dogs and cats
   present/detected in video are compulsorily included in final resized video.

#. **ENFORCE_FEATURES.CAR**  (bool, optional) – defaults to **False**
   In case of this parameter set as true, It is ensured that all CARs present/detected 
   in video are compulsorily included in final resized video.

#. **ENFORCE_FEATURES.OBJECT**  (bool, optional) – defaults to **False**
   In case of this parameter set as true, It is ensured that all objects detected 
   in video are compulsorily included in final resized video.


.. _Katna.mediapipe_integration:

Mediapipe Autoflip Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Katna uses python multiprocessing to create a pool of processes based on the number of cpu cores on machine, 
and launch processes to resize video on these cores. For example on a 12 core machine, if 4 videos needs
to be resized in parallel, Katna will launch mediapipe autoflip pipeline for 4 videos on 4 cores.

Since mediapipe is installed outside of Katna, mediaipie autoflip pipeline is launched using the 
python subprocess module. To ensure smooth run, Katna needs build autorun directory path (where binaries are build)
and also the mediapipe models directory which containe tflite (tensorflow lite models for CPU). Internally, Katna creates
a simlink to the models folder directory during its instance of execution. This allow
Katna to access the models file required to run autoflip pipeline.

Below you can see a simple architecture describing the integration:

.. figure:: images/mediapipe_autoflip_integration.jpeg
         :width: 100%
         :align: center
         :alt: Katna Mediapipe Autoflip Integration


Katna provides an interface to configure autoflip. This enables Katna to hide the complexity
of autoflip graphs configuration (.pbtxt file) and provide users will relevant configurations
in the form of python friendly dictionary. Behind the scenes, Katna will create a temporary graph (.pbtxt)
file based on the configuration provided and use it to run the autoflip pipeline.

Katna users can check **temp_pbtxt** directory when the pipeline is running to look at 
the mediapipe autoflip graph file. The folders gets deleted automatically when the pipeline
finishes its execution.

To check the list of configurable options, check :ref:`Katna.video_resize`. 


Katna.image Module:
---------------------

This module handles the task(s) for smart cropping.
The Smart crop feature tries to automatically identify important image
areas where the user will focus more and tries to retain it while cropping.
For a given input cropping dimension/final output image size, Katna.image works
by first extracting all possible image crop given crop specification using 
katna.crop_extractor module, Katna.crop_selector module then uses various filtering
and selection criteria to select best crops from list of image crops.
Let's read more about these two modules in details. 

Katna.crop_extractor module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Katna.crop_extractor module works by given a crop specification using a sliding
window approach it first calculates all possible crop see
**_get_all_possible_crops()** function inside Katna.crop_extractor module.
Additionally it applies rule of third and crop rectangle distance from edge score.
Configurations related to these scoring rules could be edited in
Katna.config.CropScorer module. 


Katna.crop_selector module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After returning candidate crops from crop_extractor module Katna.crop_selector
module first does further filtering using Katna.image_filters filters.
At the moment only text filter is supported. Text filter ensures that
if cropped rectangle contains text, texts present is not abruptly cropped.

After performing crop_filtering crop selection is done by first calculating 
additional crop scoring is done based on following criteria: Saliency,
edge features and Face features.
This score is then combined with rule of third and crop distance from edge feature
calculated in crop_extractor module.
Configurations related to these scoring rules could be edited in
Katna.config.CropScorer, Katna.config.EdgeFeature, Katna.config.FaceFeature modules.
